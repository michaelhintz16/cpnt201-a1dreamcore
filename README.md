# cpnt201-a1dreamcore
this is the second template for dream core this one is not a casino template and it is a little more simple 
its created by michael hintz ( taken from https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page262/deno)
things changed to it. the top header. instead of just saying dream it now says dream on. there is about three texts in blue that have been changed to be bolded. 
im not sure why but i tried to change it to dream core but for some  strange reasone that wouldent alow.
